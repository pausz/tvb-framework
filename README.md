# TVB FRAMEWORK

The Virtual Brain framework is a complete framework including:

- a plugable workflow manager;
- a data persistence layer (with a relational DB and File Storage);
- a browser-based user interface;
- visualizers for neuro-science related entities.

The easiest way to use the framework from the Git repo is to obtain
a distribution of TVB with Python & all the necessary packages: please
follow the instructions [in our documentation](https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/docs/blob/trunk/README.md).

Alternatively, if you plan to develop with TVB, extensively modify code,
or prefer to use your own Python installation, you may prefer to use the
[tvb-pack](https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-pack) repo which gathers together several required modules and a
few helpful tools.

If you don't require the framework features listed above, the simulator 
and associated scientific modules can be used independently; please see
the [tvb-library](https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-library) repo.

For more details, please see our [full documentation](http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/).

Enjoy TVB!
